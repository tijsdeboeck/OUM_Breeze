## How to use the OU start theme

1.  OU start theme is not meant to be used as a base theme. Instead, rename and edit it directly. Any upgrades will **not** be backwards compatible.
2.  Edit the directory name to your choosing.
3.  Edit the _OU2014.info_ filename to _&lt;name&gt;.info_.
4.  Modify the contents of your _&lt;name&gt;.info_ file to suit its new name.
5.  Change all function names in the _template_*.php_ files to your new theme name.
6.  Delete this _README.md_ file.
7.  Theme away...
